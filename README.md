# Prolog-Labs
Repository for my CS 362 Prolog labs.

# Lab 4
Lab required four predicates:
* `median(A,B,C,X)` which states that X is the median of A,B,C.
* `contains(L,X)` which states that the list L contains X.
* `largerEqual(L,X)` which states that X is larger than every element in the list L.
* `max(L,X)` which states that X is the maximum of the numbers in the list L. Must use previous predicates `contains` and `largerEqual`.

Source code can be found in `/Lab 4/lab4.pl`.
